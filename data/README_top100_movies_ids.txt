=================================================

This is a collection of the top-rated 100 movies from the site filmcrave.com.

The file contains a list of the movies in the following format:

movie_id_number|movie_name

I intend for this dataset to be a usable resource for the movie recommendation
database built using MongoDB, but it can be used for any small test dataset
involving recommendation.
